# info for Mars

Cold and dry, soil is rusty red. A nice hue of orange dominates the landscape.

Oh look, a rover! It seems Curious...

The two moons are oddly shaped, like potatoes.

Dust storm approaching! Seeking shelter.

Once the dust cleared, some of the rocks have formed standing up in a humanoid shape.

They seem friendly!
